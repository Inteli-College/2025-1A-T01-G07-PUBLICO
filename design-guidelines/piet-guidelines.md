## Brand Philosophy and Essence
PIET, founded in 2012 by Pedro Andrade, positions itself as a "portrait of the young spirit of a generation." Its core philosophy is the "unusual union of streetwear, sportswear, art, and urban subcultures." This fusion is consistently presented with a "subtle sense of humor and sophistication."

The brand's identity appears to be oriented towards Industrial Design. Andrade applies this foundation to find "intelligent and functional solutions," considering the industrial-scale production process from conception. This gives the pieces a "more utilitarian and functional DNA." The brand operates as an "anthropological study" of fashion, as expressed in the slogan "Studying millennials behavior since 2012."

The inspirations are deeply Brazilian, ranging from Andrade's childhood in the interior of São Paulo to national artistic movements. The goal is clear: to propel Brazilian and Latin American culture to the world through design.

## Logo
PIET's identity uses a flexible and dynamic logo system that adapts to the purpose of the communication, rather than relying on a single rigid symbol. This system is composed of a stable primary identifier and variable secondary identifiers.

The brand's primary identifier is a wordmark with the name "PIET" in uppercase letters.

Analysis: The typography is sans-serif, geometric, and clean, which visually reinforces the brand's connection to the principles of industrial design: clarity, functionality, and order. Its application is generally minimalist, allowing the collection's concept or the piece's design to take center stage.

<br/>In addition to the wordmark, PIET uses a symbolic logo, which consists of an asterisk formed by six bottle silhouettes. This symbol appears recurrently on various pieces and communications, functioning as a key brand icon.

This symbol is the perfect materialization of the brand's philosophy. It unites a universal and almost technical graphic element (the asterisk *) with an icon of popular culture and socialization (the bottle). This fusion represents the union of design with urban subcultures, executed with the "subtle sense of humor and sophistication" that the brand preaches. It is memorable, versatile, and carries a layer of meaning that goes beyond simple aesthetics.

#### Collection Emblems
For thematic collections, the brand develops specific emblems that function as secondary logos. Notable examples are the "PIET F.C." emblem for the "Farmers League" collection and the graphics for the "Surfing Drums" collection.

These emblems are conceptual and serve to deepen the narrative of each collection. "Farmers League" explores the culture of football supporters, while "Surfing Drums" delves into the influence of 90s surfwear on Brazilian streetwear, crossing it with funk culture. They function more like the seal of a fictitious club or movement than a traditional fashion logo, which is aligned with the brand's storytelling approach.

#### Observed Application Guidelines
| Observed Practices | Analysis and Justification |
|---|---|
| **Generous Spacing** | The logo is often applied with ample clear space margins. |
| **Clear Contrast** | Monochrome versions (black, white, or blue) are used to ensure maximum legibility on various backgrounds, reinforcing the principle of functionality. |
| **Absence of Effects** | No applications with distortions, shadows, or other visual effects are observed. The purity of the form is maintained, aligned with the functional aesthetic. |

## Colors
PIET's color palette is deliberately sophisticated. Instead of sticking to a restricted set of brand colors, the observed strategy is the use of a neutral and elevated base palette that serves as the foundation for the identity, complemented by thematic accent colors that vary with each collection.

###### Base Brand Palette

PIET's color strategy is deliberately sophisticated. Instead of sticking to a restricted set, the brand uses a neutral base palette as a foundation, complemented by accent colors that vary with each collection.

Black (#000000)<br/>
White (#FFFFFF)<br/>
Picton Blue (#68B8DD)<br/>
Bone (#DCD5C5)<br/>

The base palette is elegant and restrained. The use of black, white, and bone creates a neutral and sophisticated foundation, while "Picton Blue" acts as an identity color point, being modern and friendly without being overly vibrant. This base allows the seasonal palettes of each collection to stand out.
The colors used in the prints and pieces of each collection are thematic and vary drastically, aligning with the proposed narrative. This variation is a key element of the brand's flexibility.

## Typography
PIET's typographic approach is a pillar of its functionalist identity, divided between the main logo's font and the support fonts used in communications.

**Primary Typography (Logo)**: The font of the "PIET" wordmark is a geometric and monospaced sans-serif. Its characteristics—such as the uniform width of the characters and shapes based on circles and straight lines—evoke precision, engineering, and a sense of digital order. It is not made to be expressive, but rather to be a seal of clarity and technical quality.

**Secondary Typography (Emblems)**: In the collection emblems, the brand allows for vast typographic exploration. Serif, calligraphic, display, and vernacular fonts are seen, always depending on the collection's concept. For example, a typography reminiscent of a football team for "PIET F.C." or one that dialogues with the surf aesthetic for "Surfing Drums." This duality between a rigid primary typography and flexible secondary ones is central to the identity.

#### Photography and Art Direction
PIET's art direction is conceptual and serves as a storytelling tool for each collection.

**Style and Composition**: The images are clean, with a considered composition that balances product, model, and environment. The approach is closer to an art editorial than a conventional streetwear lookbook, conveying sophistication.

**Themes and Scenarios**: The settings are chosen to reinforce the narrative, contextualizing the clothing within a specific cultural universe. Examples include the Pacaembu Stadium for the "Farmers League" collection or the exploration of São Paulo's urban textures in the collaboration with Swarovski. This practice aligns directly with the brand's mission of translating Brazilian culture.
