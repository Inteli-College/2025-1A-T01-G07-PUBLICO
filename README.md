## Abstract

This research examines the intersection of generative design and branding, with a focus on the dynamic construction of visual identities. Challenging the traditional perception of a visual identity as a static symbol, this study posits that a brand’s visual expression can evolve over time through algorithm-driven systems. The research is underpinned by robust theoretical frameworks drawn from branding, design systems, and computational creativity.

A narrative literature review anchors the discussion, while empirical investigations, including semi-structured interviews with design professionals, practical experiments in logo generation (covering both reinterpretations of existing identities and the creation of novel designs), A/B testing, and focus groups, are employed to validate the hypothesis. These multi-method approaches not only illustrate how generative design strategies foster adaptability and innovation, but also elucidate their capacity to either reinforce or challenge conventional brand aesthetics and communication.

## Introduction

In an era where visual communication is increasingly mediated by technology, brands are adopting Dynamic Visual Identity (DVI) systems, which require innovative approaches for building brand identities, positioning generative design as a tool capable of redefining creative processes and aesthetic outcomes (FEKETE, 2022). Despite its transformative potential, the adoption of this methodology in the Brazilian and global graphic design context remains incipient, with gaps in understanding how its algorithmic techniques can challenge traditional paradigms, impacting visual perception and the audience’s emotional connection with brands (VIEIRA; BRUSCATO, 2023). This study seeks to investigate the influence of generative design on visual identity creation processes, focusing on aesthetic innovation and the enhancement of sensory experiences, exploring its theoretical foundations to practical industry applications.

The research, exploratory in nature and qualitative in approach, combines a narrative literature review, semi-structured interviews with professionals working in generative design, and practical experiments in logo generation, including reinterpretations of existing visual identities and original creations. Through A/B testing, focus groups, and other evaluation methods, public perceptions of the generated variants will be analyzed to assess how these solutions influence brand image. Concurrently, an investigation of the industrial landscape will identify the interest and challenges faced by companies in adopting these techniques, highlighting emblematic cases and emerging trends.

By integrating theoretical analysis, experimental practice, and dialogue with the market, the study aims to map the contributions of generative design to the branding field and propose pathways for its strategic application, reinforcing its role as a catalyst for dynamic, contextualized, and sensory-driven visual identities. The relevance of this research lies in its potential to expand academic studies on Dynamic Visual Identities, particularly those utilizing generative design.

## Brand and Branding

In academic discourse, precise conceptual distinctions are critical. Central to this study is the differentiation between brand and branding. Adopting the Label and Associations Model (LAM), brand is defined as a conceptual entity anchored in a name, logo, or visual identifier that signals product origin and stimulates cognitive, emotional, or symbolic associations. These associations, while diverse, remain tethered to the brand’s core identifier (AVIS; HENDERSON, 2021). Branding, in contrast, constitutes the strategic process of intentionally shaping, managing, and evolving these associations to align with organizational goals, cultural contexts, and consumer perceptions (SCHROEDER, 2005; SCHROEDER, 2017).

Beyond corporate utility, brands and branding function as ideological constructs operating at the intersection of commerce, culture, and academia. Schroeder (2017) frames brands as sociocultural artifacts that simultaneously serve as economic assets and semiotic systems, shaping consumer identities, corporate narratives, and even societal values. This duality positions branding as a practice of *meaning-making*, where visual, linguistic, and symbolic elements coalesce to construct brand narratives (SCHROEDER, 2005).

From a consumer perspective, brands transcend transactional roles, evolving into relational personas that engender trust, exclusivity, and communal identity (WHEELER, 2017). For organizations, they represent strategic assets critical for differentiation and sustained market relevance. David Haigh (2004), CEO of Brand Finance, delineates three functional pillars of branding:

- **Navigation**: The brand’s capacity to simplify consumer decision-making in saturated markets.

- **Reaffirmation**: Its role in post-purchase validation, reinforcing consumer confidence in quality.

- **Engagement**: The strategic use of imagery, language, and symbolism to cultivate emotional resonance.

As illustrated in Figure 1, brand touchpoint serve as critical junctures for shaping perception. These interactions collectively define brand image, encompassing reputation, values, and cultural relevance. Distinctly, brand identity refers to the deliberate materialization of these abstractions through visual and sensory elements: logos, typography, color systems, and tonal voice (WHEELER, 2017).

Branding is not a static endeavor but a continuous, iterative process of adaptation, demanding perpetual adaptation to cultural shifts, market dynamics, and consumer expectations. Avis and Henderson (2021) emphasize that effective branding requires organizational alignment, from executive strategy to employee conduct, to ensure cohesive communication and consistent customer experiences.

Visual elements are key to branding, serving as both identifiers and cultural signifiers. Schroeder (2005) asserts that brands are inherently visual; logos, packaging, and advertisements rely on design to encode meaning. For instance, Andy Warhol’s Campbell’s Soup series transformed the brand’s visual identity into a cultural icon, demonstrating how design transcends aesthetics to become a historical artifact.

Within the LAM framework, the logo and name act as primary stimuli for associations, making visual consistency paramount to recognition and equity (AVIS; HENDERSON, 2021). Color psychology, typography, and compositional aesthetics further anchor emotional responses. Thus, visual identity is not ancillary but central to branding’s capacity to convey meaning, foster loyalty, and navigate cultural discourse.


## Visual Identity

Visual identity serves as the tangible manifestation of a brand, synthesizing recognition, emotion, and narrative into a cohesive system. It transcends aesthetics, acting as a semiotic framework that communicates brand values, differentiates from competitors, and fosters consumer loyalty (LY DANG, 2018). A robust Visual Identity System (VIS) integrates typography, color, language, and logo into a unified strategy, balancing consistency with adaptability to meet hypermodern demands (LELIS et al., 2020; VAN NES, 2012).

The logo operates as the VIS’s keystone, distilling brand essence into a singular graphic form that synthesizes identity, values, and market positioning. Beyond mere visual shorthand, it functions as a semiotic anchor, encoding complex narratives into structural elements (shapes, symbols, and typography) that resonate across cultural and linguistic boundaries (LY DANG, 2018).

Consider Heidi Cody’s American Alphabet (WHEELER, 2017), which deconstructs iconic brand logos into fragmented letterforms. Despite partial occlusion, viewers instantly recognize brands like Coca-Cola or McDonald’s, demonstrating how ingrained visual identities become through consistent typographic and chromatic repetition. This phenomenon aligns with Lelis et al.’s (2020) findings: even dynamic logos retain structural axes (e.g., stroke proportions) to ensure recognizability amidst variation.

*Figure 3. Modern American Alphabet (WHEELER, 2017)*

Brands like Nike and Apple exemplify symbolic minimalism. By stripping logos to abstract forms (the Swoosh, the Apple silhouette), they achieve cross-cultural immediacy. Nike’s evolution from a wordmark to a standalone symbol reflects strategic simplification, ensuring scalability across digital and physical touchpoints (WHEELER, 2017). This minimalist approach, however, relies on decades of chromatic consistency, Nike’s black-and-white palette and Apple’s monochromatic apple, to anchor recognition (LELIS, 2019).

Typography transcends mere text representation; it embodies brand voice. Serif fonts like Times New Roman can evoke tradition and authority, while sans-serif fonts like Helvetica signal modernity and accessibility (LELIS et al., 2020). Crucially, legibility (individual character clarity) and readability (text block comprehension) must coexist (LELIS et al., 2020).

Dynamic visual identities further challenge typographic norms. Variable fonts, such as Fit by David Ross, adapt width and weight responsively, maintaining structural integrity across devices, a necessity in multi-platform branding (LELIS et al., 2020). This flexibility mirrors Van Nes’s (2012) "Container" category, where typography remains constant while other elements mutate.

Color’s role in VIS extends beyond aesthetics; it encodes meaning and drives behavior. It can be defined by three perceptual attributes: hue (spectral position), value/lightness (brightness/darkness), and saturation/chroma (vibrancy) (LELIS, 2019). 

![Captura de tela de 2025-04-11 23-47-35](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a56cf06-1f50-4da3-95b9-5bc3c03db5a6)

*Figure 9. Colour Spectrum.*

Lelis (2019) categorizes color harmonies as follows:

- **Monochromatic**: "Rel[y] on one single hue, but may include value/saturation variations of the same unique hue."

- **Analogous**: "Characterised by the combination of hues which lie adjacent to each other in the hue spatial circle."

- **Complementary**: "The combination of any two hues occupying opposite positions in the spatial circle."

- **Triadic**: "The combination of any three hues occupying equidistant positions."

- **Tetradic**: "A composition of any four hues occupying equidistant positions."

*Figure 10. Lelis' Colour Harmony Categorization.*

Modern brands increasingly adopt polychromatic variations, where "each variation includes more than four hue families" (LELIS, 2019). However, traditional schemes like Nike’s monochromatic black-and-white palette demonstrate how chromatic consistency anchors recognition across decades, as said previously (LELIS, 2019).

The interplay of logo, typography, and color defines VIS efficacy. Dynamic brands like MTV exemplify this balance: their logos morph in color and texture, yet retain typographic proportions (x-height, stroke weight) to preserve recognition (LELIS et al., 2020). This aligns with Van Nes’s (2012) "DNA" category, where a core element (e.g., type structure) anchors identity amidst mutation.

## Generative Design

According to Philip Galanter,<br>
```Generative [design] refers to any [design] practice where the [designer] uses a system, such as a set of natural language rules, a computer program, a machine, or other procedural invention, which is set into motion with some degree of autonomy contributing to or resulting in a completed work of [design]. (GALANTER, 2003)```

Generative design consists of a creative practice that employ systems as essential tools for creation. Its central distinction lies in the intentional introduction of stochastic elements into the creative process, which generate unpredictable and diverse results within a set of rules (Figure 5). According to Galanter, generative systems operate in the zone of effective complexity, where order and disorder coexist to produce structured yet unpredictable patterns (GALANTER, 2003).

![pg](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be306500-9213-4e87-99b8-a7c1ca511039)

*Figure 12. Relationship between order, disorder, and effective complexity. (FLAKE apud GALANTER, 2003).*

These stochastic elements not only expand the formal repertoire of the work but also reconfigure the dynamics of creation, allowing the artist to act as a systems architect, defining parameters, boundaries, and degrees of randomness, while the system assumes operational execution (BAILEY, 2018).

When a designer uses a computational system for generative work, scalability becomes one of the most notable characteristics of this method. By delegating repetitive and computationally intensive tasks to algorithms, generative design optimizes processes that would be unfeasible manually, such as the exhaustive exploration of variations or the simulation of emergent behaviors (BAILEY, 2018). As pioneering generative artist Vera Molnár highlighted, *"Without the aid of a computer, it would not be possible to materialize quite so faithfully an image that previously existed only in the artist's mind. This may sound paradoxical, but the machine, which is thought to be cold and inhuman, can help to realize what is most subjective, unattainable, and profound in a human being."* (MOLNÁR apud BAILEY, 2018). However, it is crucial to emphasize that technology does not define the essence of generative art, but rather the adoption of systems with some degree of autonomy, whether analog (such as mathematical rules or physical processes) or digital (programs and algorithms).

The distinction between what is or is not generative design lies primarily in the creative process, and sometimes in the resulting aesthetics. Although generative works often exhibit complex patterns, modular repetitions, or systematic variations, these visual traits are not always sufficient for classification. For example, in art history, the gestural paintings of Jackson Pollock, despite their seemingly chaotic patterns, are not generative, as they depend on the artist’s continuous decisions. In contrast, the combinatorial drawings (Wall Drawings) of Sol Lewitt, based on predefined instructions, may align with the concept of generative art, even when executed manually. (GALANTER, 2003)

<br></br>

In summary, generative art and design are defined by the dialectical relationship between the artist and systems with a degree of autonomy, in which creative control is negotiated. The artist establishes rules, boundaries, and aesthetics, while the system reinterprets them, generating results that may challenge, complement, or expand the initial intention. This interaction, sometimes collaborative, sometimes antagonistic, transcends mere technical application, transforming the creative process into an exploration of the boundaries between predictability and emergence (GALANTER, 2003; BAILEY, 2018).

Generative design transforms visual identities by replacing static logos with dynamic, context-responsive systems. A prime example is Casa da Musica, whose identity adapts to real-time inputs: its logo morphs based on architectural perspectives and color palettes extracted from event-specific imagery, ensuring each application reflects the venue’s diverse cultural programming. Similarly, Nordkyn’s branding integrates live weather data, wind direction and temperature, to generate logos that update every five minutes, embodying the region’s slogan, “Where nature rules.” These cases exemplify how generative design transcends aesthetic novelty, embedding variability and environmental responsiveness into brand DNA. By prioritizing algorithmic frameworks over fixed forms, such systems address the need for identities to evolve alongside contextual, cultural, or climatic shifts. These are challenges static logos inherently fail to reconcile (GUIDA, 2014).
