# Content Analysis: Perspectives on Generative Design in Visual Identities

### 1. Introduction

This document presents a content analysis of two semi-structured interviews with generative design experts Patrik Hübner (international practice) and André Burnier (Brazilian market practice). The objective of the investigation is to understand the perspectives and practical experiences of these professionals regarding the application, challenges, and impact of generative design on the processes and outcomes of visual identities. The analysis seeks to contrast the experts' views to identify thematic convergences and divergences influenced by their respective professional contexts.

### 2. Methodology

This study adopts Content Analysis as a qualitative research methodology, based on the precepts of Bardin (1977), as detailed in the reference article. The methodological choice is justified by its effectiveness in "understanding the meanings and senses of messages, which go beyond a common reading." The process was structured in accordance with the three chronological poles proposed by Bardin:

1.  **Pre-analysis:** The interview transcripts were defined as the research *corpus*. After a floating reading for familiarization, the research objectives and the original script questions were used as a guide for the material's systematization.
2.  **Material Analysis:** The *corpus* was subjected to a process of coding and categorization. The chosen registration unit was the **theme**, seeking to identify the "cores of meaning that make up the communication." The extracted codes were grouped into thematic categories that directly mirror the structure of the interview script, ensuring the relevance of the analysis.
3.  **Treatment of Results and Interpretation:** The categorized data were interpreted with the objective of making inferences and constructing a synthesis that articulates the interviewees' discourses. The interpretation focused on the contrast between national and international perspectives, seeking to reveal patterns and contextual particularities.

### 3. Thematic Analysis and Discussion

The analysis resulted in three main categories, derived directly from the question blocks of the interview script.

#### 3.1. Creative Process, Tools, and Workflow

In this category, the reconfiguration of the design process, the professional's role, and the tools used are explored. A notable convergence is the view of code as a tool, not as an end in itself.

-   **Patrik Hübner** describes a fundamental shift in the process: instead of "superimposing" a character onto a brand, he seeks to understand the "phenomenon" in its essence and use data for the brand to "project itself." His role transcends that of a traditional designer, becoming a mix of "creative director, strategist, systems architect, and programmer." His workflow is based on web technologies (WebGL, Vue.js) to ensure maximum interactivity and reach.
-   **André Burnier** positions programming as a later stage after a "minimum graphic direction," which is still born on paper. Often, his work consists of "translating" or "reproducing something that was done without programming." He defines himself as a "designer who learned to code," which reinforces the primacy of design thinking over technical execution. His role is often that of a specialist hired by agencies that do not have this expertise internally.

#### 3.2. Relationship with the Market and Clients

This category highlights the most pronounced divergence between the contexts, revealing the different levels of maturity and the challenges in the relationship with clients.

-   **Patrik Hübner** points out that although maturity regarding the potential of generative design is low globally, there is a growing demand in saturated markets (UK, USA), where brands seek it as a strong **competitive differentiator**. He confirms that there is a constant effort to "educate people about the possibilities," encouraging them to go beyond automation and focus on storytelling.
-   **André Burnier** is emphatic in assessing the maturity of the Brazilian market as "almost zero." He attributes this difficulty to a devaluation of design in general. Generative design is perceived as a **risk**, due to the "loss of control," and an additional cost. The educational work, in his case, is not limited to the end client but also includes the design agencies themselves, which are often having their first contact with the approach.

#### 3.3. Aesthetics, Innovation, and Brand Perception

Here, the experts reflect on the aesthetic impact of generative design and the central challenge of maintaining identity consistency.

-   **Patrik Hübner** argues that generative design does not create a specific aesthetic, but that its visual result is a consequence of the **process**. He observes an evolution from abstract forms to visuals with a greater semiotic load. Consistency, for him, is achieved through a balance between static and flexible elements, where the system's own **narrative** acts as the main factor of recognition and cohesion.
-   **André Burnier** describes the aesthetic potential as a "Pandora's box," a response to the need for variation in a digital world where the audience gets bored quickly. For him, the innovation lies in creating brands with "personality, movement," breaking the paradigm of the "single graphic mark."

### 4. Cross-Analysis: International vs. National Context

The comparison of discourses allows for a clear parallel to be drawn between the two market scenarios.

| Axis of Analysis | **Patrik Hübner (International)** | **André Burnier (National)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Market Trigger** | Search for **differentiation** in saturated markets. | Initial explorations, motivated by innovation marketing and "high-tech" appeal. |
| **Process Approach** | **Strategic and data-driven.** The generative system is the starting point for the brand's expression. | **Tactical and design-oriented.** Programming is used to enable and expand a pre-defined visual direction. |
| **Main Challenge** | Elevating the conversation with the client from the "how" (technology) to the "why" (strategy and narrative). | Justifying the value of design itself and educating agencies and clients about the fundamentals and potential of the approach. |
| **Brand Consistency** | Anchored in **narrative (storytelling)** and the balance between fixed and variable elements. | Focused on ensuring that visual variation does not mischaracterize the central identity, a sensitive point for risk-averse clients. |

### 5. Thematic Code Structure for a Word Cloud

The raw data from the transcripts were coded to extract the most recurrent and significant concepts. The table below organizes these codes in a structured way, serving as a basis for creating a visual word cloud. The organization reflects the thematic categories of the analysis, highlighting the central codes (which would have greater weight in the cloud), their descriptors, and, crucially, the terms that show the divergences between the national and international contexts.

| Thematic Category | Central Codes (Key Concepts) | Related Codes and Descriptors | Contextual Codes (Divergent) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Creative Process and Workflow** | **PROCESS** <br> **TOOL** <br> **SYSTEM** <br> **ROLE (of the professional)** | Code, Workflow, Rules, Curation, Direction, Autonomy, Interactivity | **Hübner (International):**<br> • `Phenomenon` <br> • `Storytelling` <br> • `Data` <br><br> **Burnier (National):** <br> • `Translation` <br> • `Sketch` <br> • `Exploration` |
| **Relationship with Market and Clients** | **MARKET** <br> **CLIENT** <br> **EDUCATE** <br> **MATURITY** | Value, Investment, Innovation, Opportunity, Adaptation, Perception | **Hübner (International):** <br> • `Differentiation` <br> • `Saturation` <br> • `Demand` <br><br> **Burnier (National):** <br> • `Risk` <br> • `Design Culture` <br> • `Cost` |
| **Aesthetics, Innovation, and Brand Perception**| **AESTHETICS** <br> **CONSISTENCY** <br> **VARIATION** <br> **BRAND** | Identity, Cohesion, Recognition, Visual Language, Movement, Flexibility, Control (loss of) | **Hübner (International):** <br> • `Balance` <br> • `Narrative as an anchor` <br> • `Authenticity` <br><br> **Burnier (National):** <br> • `"Pandora's Box"` <br> • `Anti-boredom` <br> • `Personality` |

### 6. Conclusion

The comparative analysis reveals that although the technical and creative foundations of generative design are global, its practice and discourse are profoundly influenced by the socioeconomic context and the maturity of the local design market.

In the international scenario, represented by Patrik Hübner, generative design is already discussed as a strategic tool for differentiation and building authentic narratives. The challenge lies in deepening its strategic potential beyond superficial innovation.

In the national context, from the perspective of André Burnier, the practice still has an experimental character and faces significant cultural and educational barriers. The primary challenge is to justify the investment and the apparent loss of control to a market that is still consolidating its perception of the value of traditional design.

It is concluded that the "technologization of society," cited by Burnier, is a vector that tends to accelerate the adoption of this approach in Brazil. However, progress will depend not only on technological evolution but also on a continuous effort to educate agencies and clients about the strategic potential of dynamic and living brands.
